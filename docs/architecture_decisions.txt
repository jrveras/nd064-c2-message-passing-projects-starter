REST
   1. Due to scalability, flexibility and portability, as well as itâ€™s simplest and easier when migrate from monolith to microservice.
   2. The server should not be keeping track of the context of client requests and responses can potentially be cached for improved performance.

Message Queue
   1. Storing messages to set up performance, improve reliability, and enable decoupling of our systems

gRPC
   1. gRPC is more structured and faster
   2. For internal systems that dictate fast performance, gRPC may be used by modules in a microservice to pass messages with one another.
